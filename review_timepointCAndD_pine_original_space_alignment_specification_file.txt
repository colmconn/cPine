TITLE Pine Timepoint C & D Original Space Aligned Brains
# This is the title that will appear at the top of the resulting web page
# Giving this more than once probably won't make it crash, but it won't do any good
## DATADIR /Volumes/opt/mriAnalyses/MDD/data
DATADIR /Volumes/PROMISEPEGASUS/yangdata/cPine/data
# This is the directory that the subject folders are in.
SUBDIR functional
# This contains any path that should be followed under the subject folder to find the data.
# The file will be at $DATADIR/$subj/$SUBDIR/$filename
## OUTDIR /Volumes/opt/mriAnalyses/MDD/data/structural_review_html
OUTDIR /Volumes/PROMISEPEGASUS/yangdata/cPine/data/pine_timepoint_CAndD_original_space_review_html
# This is where the outputs go.  This directory will be created.
# If it exists already, we'll give it a number.
# If you give this more than once, or not at the beginning, this whole thing won't work.
#UNDERLAY ${SUBJ}_1_T1High+tlrc
# This is the name of the underlay file to use for rendering the image.
# For afni format files, leave off the +orig or +tlrc.
# For .nii files, give the full filename.
COLORSCALE Spectrum:red_to_blue
# This is the name of the colorscale to use, as the names appear in the afni viewer.
OPACITY 7
# This is the opacity of the functional map on top of the anatomical underlay.
# Can be 0-9.  Default is 9, full opacity.  You don't need to give this if you want to use the default.
THRESHTYPE raw
# This tells you whether the threshold is given as a "raw" value in the chosen brik,
# or as a calculated "p"-value, which requires the brik to have proper statistical parameters associated with it
RANGE 0
# The colorscale will run over the colorscale_subbrik values in the range -RANGE to +RANGE.
# If this is not given, or set to zero, then range is calculated automatically for each individual image.
# You might not want that if you want to be able to compare images with each other.
# Don't give this keyword with a blank value, that will screw things up.
VIEW orig
# This tells you whether to set the afni viewer to "orig" or "tlrc" view.
# If your images came from afni processing, you'll get better results with tlrc,
# because they will be visually comparable across subjects.
# If all the images come from the same scan session then it doesn't matter.
# If your input images were all registered to atlas space already, in some other program,
# then use orig for good results.
#
# Each one of these specifies the image for one column of the output.
# Here we set it up for five columns in the output table.
# The format is filename colorscale_subbrik thresh_subbrik slice_direction threshold xcoord ycoord zcoord
